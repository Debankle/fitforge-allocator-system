# FitForge Allocation System

This repository contains the work and research of T039 throughout our study in units IFB398 and IFB399 of 2024. As such, this README is designed to guide you through our repository of work.

For simplicity, we suggest beginning in the Reports folder, reading the pdf contained within, `Overview of the Allocation Project: Year-Long Research, Experiments, and Future Recommendations.pdf` as this will provide the necessary understanding of all the work and context through the year.

There are four main sections, as can be seen from the folders at the top layer. The meeting minutes contain the documented notes of discussions held with the IFB398 unit coordinator Professor David Lovell, as we discussed various aspects of the project. This was a very significant portion of our work, as the insights gained from these were often non-tangible and led to new research direction as ideas were shared and discussed.

The Prototype System folder contains just that - our prototype experimental system we developed as a technology probe. It was used to test our understanding of the project and the overall allocation process and in comparing its use to the current system, we gained significant insight into how a system should be developed.

The system is a nodejs web app. It can be run by moving into the directory and using the node commands outlined in the package.json file.

The scripts folder contains a few scripts created as the project was developed, and our understanding changed. They are not all part of any specific section, but could be relevant to look back on. Currently they include
- the results of the experiment undertaken in phase 2
- initial attempts at developing an ILP algorithm for the dataset

Finally, the reports folder contains our most significant work from the year, divided into three phases. Inside, a file can be found called `Overview of the Allocation Project: Year-Long Research, Experiments, and Future Recommendations`. This file is a summary of our understanding and work over the year. For more detail into each phase, we have broken that into further subdirectories.

Phase 1 contains our intial research and reccomendations on how an allocation system should be designed, along with deriving and determining the requirements and constraints for such a system

Phase 2 contains the reports involved with the development of the experimental system, the weekly logs, our sprint plan, and the system design report, as well as the report detailing the results of our experiment.

Phase 3 contains four subdirectories, each dedicated to one of the four salient aspects of an allocation system identified in phase 2. Each directory contains a report detailing the research and exploration of the topic, along with any scripts, extra research or testing developed during the period.
