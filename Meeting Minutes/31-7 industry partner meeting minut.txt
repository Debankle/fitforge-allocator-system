Notes
When making report, work out what user wants and observe the user
Present feedback from the industry partner and incorporate it into report. Substance
Happy moving it backwards
He’s still getting team and student info
Will use to form matrices;
Impact matrix (binary indicators)
Capability matrix
Hoping whatever he gives can be massaged into whatever we have
Might add additional column for impact tier
Needs to have allocation in hand
Get on the front foot with shae, this is what we’re doing and this is why we’re thinking about doing
Bring insight, new perspectives and inject the project with things David couldn’t come up with
Look at screen recording from a user experience POV
First screen recording, then second with assisted updated systems
User faffing around clicking around spreadsheets - get insight into how a person works
Explicitly visualize and present things so that when it gets handed over it’s direct on what needs to be worked on
More talking from all members for user interaction and experience - also helps david write a better report for us
That was everything i think
