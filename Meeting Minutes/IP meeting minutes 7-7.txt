David was a little confused
Lists all the units passed in terms of Software development, MobDev, UX, etv
Online and internal and international listed as well
Don’t want to put too many students with unknown quantities together as problems occur - no track record
No groups of three
When team has same level of impact then project gets assigned (David’s system)
David showing his system:
Has this ‘smarties looking visualization’ which shows team fit for projects - Looks very interesting 
Realized had to write another version of viewer where the fits disappear after confirming allocation - took some time for him
The allocation he had was good but realized that teams without good capability fit caused problems therefore his system proved difficult
Discovered he allocated a team twice and one project twice accidentally - needs guard rails to prevent him from allocating mindlessly
Definitely needs a manual allocation system to make teams happy
Don’t hold Davids hand through going through the allocation system so that we have useful data and a good artifact for our report: next week 9-11:30am
